A **wolf** is a large canine animal. It has a broad snout, round ears, a thick neck, and two layers of fur. It has a strong bite and good endurance.

Wolf [bodies](Body.md) are cooperative and social, yet extremely territorial. They prefer to stick to groups (or "packs"), which usually consists of a wolf pair and their children, though younger wolves may leave this group to start their own. They are known for their loud prolonged "howl", which they use to find and bond with wolves in their pack, and to keep other wolves away. They prefer to eat meat, either from hunting or scavenging.
