A [fae's](<../Fae.md>) [body](<../Æther/Body.md>) requires sleep daily, although their [spark](<../Æther/Spark.md>) does not require sleep at all. Regardless, fae usually sleep with their spark diffused into their body.

While sleeping, the fae's body sorts through its memories as well as the accompanied spark's, resulting in dreaming. This process is very similar to [resolving](<../Æther/Resolving.md>), as the fae, upon waking up, gains some memory of their dreams. Like when resolving, their subconscious spark automatically tries to create a narrative of the memories.
