Both the [body](<../Æther/Body.md>) and the [spark](<../Æther/Spark.md>) can, in a sense, die.

A body is typically considered dead when its physical, biological functions ceases to function. A spark can remain diffused in the body's skeleton, but without consciousness from a living body, it cannot easily sustain this diffusion. Without external energy, a spark will continuously [resolve](<../Æther/Resolving.md>) from a dead body.

A spark is dead if it is reduced in size and power to no longer function. [Wind](<../Æther/Wind.md>) is the most common cause of this, as strong enough fluctuations can tear the spark apart. [Metamutagen](<../Materials/Metamutagen.md>) can also destroy a spark if it does not have a layer that naturally resists its pull.
