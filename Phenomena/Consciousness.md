In the context of [Æther](<../README.md>), **consciousness** refers not to physical wakefulness but rather to a state of self-awareness. A conscious being is capable of identifying themself and are aware of their existence and impact on the universe.

Consciousness is simply the result of a [body](<../Æther/Body.md>) interacting with a [spark](<../Æther/Spark.md>). If a spark is [diffused](<../Æther/Diffusing.md>) into a body, then the body has consciousness. Such a being is called a [fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>). A body without a spark is conversely not a conscious being but rather an unaware animal.

Simply put, somebody is "sapient" if they have a spark. If somebody has a spark, they are "sapient". This level of awareness and intelligence is an objective feature.

The [power](<../Æther/Spark.md#Power>) of the spark and body do not correlate with the intelligence or awareness of a fae; a larger brain or stronger spark do not necessitate a smarter fae. The power of a spark *is* often indicative of one's willpower, however.
