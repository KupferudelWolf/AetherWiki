The **Shattering** was a catastrophic event that caused, among other events, the land surrounding [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>) to become [Shifting Lands](<../Locations/Shifting Lands.md>). It was caused when the [æther](<../Æther/Æther.md>)'s ground state and neutral state of equilibrium dropped to a very slightly lower state.
