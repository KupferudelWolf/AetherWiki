**Luxtia** is the large region around the [Cirrolite Core](<./Cirrolite Core.md>) where all known [fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>) currently live. It is roughly circular with a 400-mile diameter. Luxtia is raised from the surrounding [Shifting Lands](<./Shifting Lands.md>), which sunk about 5 kilometers down during [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>). [Skygrazer](<./Skygrazer.md>) stands in the middle.

As the Cirrolite Core is slowly weakening over time, the border of Luxtia is shrinking, its borders collapsing into the Shifting Lands.

## Geography
The geography of Luxtia is fairly varied, though usually cold.

[Skygrazer]'s peak is directly in the middle of Luxtia and is the highest in the area. In the daytime, winds typically blow outward and down, into the Shifting Lands, before rising into the atmosphere and moving back inward. At night, this is reversed. However, the wind can vary depending on the conditions of the Shifting Lands.

The northern region of [{{NORTH}}](<./{{NORTH}}.md>) is an arable region prone to thunderstorms. It is very flat, becoming hilly only at the extreme southern edge. [Callisto](<./Western Citadels/Callisto.md>) of [Jupiter](<./Jupiter.md>), and both [Dione](<./Eastern Citadels/Dione.md>) and [Enceladus](<./Eastern Citadels/Enceladus.md>) of [Saturn](<./Saturn.md>) are located in this region.

The western region of [{{WEST}}](<./{{WEST}}.md>) is the driest region. Most of the region is desert, with little arable land. Jupiter controls the entire region; the citadels of [Ganymede](<./Western Citadels/Ganymede.md>), [Europa](<./Western Citadels/Europa.md>), and [Io](<./Western Citadels/Io.md>) are located along [{{WESTERN RIVER}}](<./{{WESTERN RIVER}}.md>), forming a straight line.

The eastern region of [{{EAST}}](<./{{EAST}}.md>) is a wet and cold region that's completely under Saturn's controls. [Mimas](<./Eastern Citadels/Mimas.md>), [Iapetus](<./Eastern Citadels/Iapetus.md>), and [Tethys](<./Eastern Citadels/Tethys.md>) are located here.

The southern region of [Serra](<./Serra.md>) is very mountainous. The western half has taller, rougher mountains, making it hard to establish infrastructure or even explore. The eastern half is smoother, though still significantly elevated. [Rhea](<./Eastern Citadels/Rhea.md>) and [Titan](<./Eastern Citadels/Titan.md>) are located here. Soil is not very arable.
