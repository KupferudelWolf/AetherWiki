**Jupiter** is one of the two nations of [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>). It covers the western half of Luxtia and contains four [citadels](<./Citadel.md>) themed around industry:
- [Callisto](<./Western Citadels/Callisto.md>) ([{{NORTH}}](<./{{NORTH}}.md>)): services
- [Ganymede](<./Western Citadels/Ganymede.md>) ([{{WEST}}](<./{{WEST}}.md>)): manufacturing
- [Europa](<./Western Citadels/Europa.md>) ([{{WEST}}](<./{{WEST}}.md>)): agriculture
- [Io](<./Western Citadels/Io.md>) ([{{WEST}}](<./{{WEST}}.md>)): extraction

Although Jupiter has territory in [Serra](<./Serra.md>), it has no citadels there; it contains mostly Io mining and lumber towns.
