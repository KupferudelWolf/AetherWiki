The **{{WESTERN RIVER}}** is a long river that starts in [Serra](<./Serra.md>) near [Skygrazer](<./Skygrazer.md>) and flows west through [{{WEST}}](<./{{WEST}}.md>) to the [Shifting Lands](<./Shifting Lands.md>). It is the primary water source for the region and its three Jovian citadels: [Europa](<./Western Citadels/Europa.md>), [Ganymede](<./Western Citadels/Ganymede.md>), and [Io](<./Western Citadels/Io.md>). The river is dangerously polluted due to the heavy industry from these citadels.
