The **Cirrolite Core** is a large geode of massive [cirrolite](<../Technology/Cirrolite.md>) crystals located in the center of [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>): directly below [Skygrazer](<./Skygrazer.md>), parallel to the effective sea level of Luxtia. It keeps [æthereal energy](<../Æther/Energy.md>) closer to the point it was before [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>), thus protecting Luxtia from falling into the [Shifting Lands](<./Shifting Lands.md>).
