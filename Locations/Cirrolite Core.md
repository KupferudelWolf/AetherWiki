The **Cirrolite Core** is a large geode of massive [cirrolite](<../Technology/Cirrolite.md>) crystals located in the center of [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>): directly below [Skygrazer](<./Skygrazer.md>), parallel to the effective sea level of Luxtia. It keeps [exergy](<../Æther/Exergy.md>) closer to the point it was before [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>), thus protecting Luxtia from [New Existence](<../Æther/New Existence.md>).

## Other Cirrolite "Cores"
Before The Shattering, 11 other similar cirrolite formations of varying sizes existed throughout the world, many larger than Luxtia's Cirrolite Core. 9 of these additional formations existed close to major population centers.

Hypothetically, any of these may have also survived The Shattering. However, none are close enough to Luxtia to be easily contacted, as the high entropy within the deeper parts of the [Shifting Lands](<./Shifting Lands.md>) heavily distorts any information passing through it.

None of the other cores existed directly north of Luxtia.
