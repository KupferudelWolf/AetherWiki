The **Cirrolite Core** is a large geode of massive [cirrolite](<../Technology/Cirrolite.md>) crystals located in the center of [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>): directly below [Skygrazer](<./Skygrazer.md>), parallel to the effective sea level of Luxtia. It keeps [exergy](<../Ã†ther/Exergy.md>) closer to the point it was before [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>), thus protecting Luxtia from [New Existence](<./New Existence.md>).
