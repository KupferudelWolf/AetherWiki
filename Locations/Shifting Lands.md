The **Shifting Lands** encompass all known "land" surrounding [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>) formed after [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>). Far from the protection of the [Cirrolite Core](<./Cirrolite Core.md>), the [Æther](<../Æther/Æther.md>) is extremely unpredictable and disrupted, causing rapid and chaotic physical changes. The further from the Cirrolite Core, the more frequent and intense these changes can be.

Despite this, [fae](<../Fae.md>) occasionally explore this region in search for resources that may have accumulated through the spontaneous changes.
