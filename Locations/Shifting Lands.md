The **Shifting Lands** encompass all known space surrounding and extending from [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>) since [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>). Far from the protection of the [Cirrolite Core](<./Cirrolite Core.md>), the [æther](<../Æther/Æther.md>) is extremely unpredictable and disrupted, causing rapid and chaotic physical changes. The further from the Cirrolite Core, the more frequent and intense these changes can be.

The Cirrolite Core is very slowly weakening over time, causing the Shifting Lands to "grow".

Despite the threats looming there, fae occasionally explore the Shifting Lands in search for resources that may have accumulated through its spontaneous changes. These fae, called [Excavator](<../Technology/Excavator.md>), are specially trained to adapt quickly to the hostile terrain.

## Weather
The level of chaos in the Shifting Lands varies in a seemingly random manner. [Fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>) can predict changes within a few minutes using various technologies. Bone dowsing rods can detect changes but may be difficult to read. Radios pick up chaotic noise in the Shifting Lands and will grow louder as the æther in the area becomes more disrupted.

## Stages
The known physics of the world breaks down further from the Cirrolite Core. This degradation is non-linear; rather, it is stepwise, with each **stage** marking where certain physical properties begin to fail.

### Stage 0
The innermost **Stage 0** is simply Luxtia. It is not considered a part of the Shifting Lands. Physics here works as it did before The Shattering.

### Stage 1
Immediately outside of Luxtia, **Stage 1** is, while dangerous, still momentarily livable for [fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>). [Excavators](<../Technology/Excavator.md>) explore this stage for rare resources.

During calm weather, Stage 1 is very similar to Stage 0. Changes in temperature and pressure, for example, are still random but nonetheless predictable.

However, intense weather can cause even fatal injuries. Lacerations are incredibly common. Matter can move upward into unstable temporary structures sometimes taller than a fae.

### Stage 2
**Stage 2** is currently impassable by fae, though research is being done into [cirrolite](<../Technology/Cirrolite.md>) gear that may allow temporary traversal. Despite this, [exfae](<../Æther/Exfae.md>) appearances seem to originate from within Stage 2, near the border to Stage 1.

This stage has a constant "fog" of random matter that shifts periodically and rapidly. Of course, fae cannot breathe this aerosol-like "fog".

### Stage 3
At **Stage 3**, the furthest known layer, the fundamental physical quantities become incomprehensible. Matter spontaneously generates and destroys rapidly, visually resembling nuclear pasta. The region is mostly exothermic, creating a bright light that bathes Luxtia in constant dawn.
