The **Shifting Lands** encompass all known "land" surrounding [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>) formed after [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>). Far from the protection of the [Cirrolite Core](<./Cirrolite Core.md>), the [æther](<../Æther/Æther.md>) is extremely unpredictable and disrupted, causing rapid and chaotic physical changes. The further from the Cirrolite Core, the more frequent and intense these changes can be.

The Cirrolite Core is very slowly weakening over time, causing the Shifting Lands to grow.

Despite the threats looming there, fae occasionally explore the Shifting Lands in search for resources that may have accumulated through its spontaneous changes. These fae, called [Excavator](<../Technology/Excavator.md>), are specially trained to adapt quickly to the hostile terrain.

## Weather
The level of chaos in the Shifting Lands varies in a seemingly random manner. [Fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>) can predict changes within a few minutes using various technologies. Bone dowsing rods can detect changes but may be difficult to read. Radios pick up chaotic noise in the Shifting Lands and will grow louder as the æther in the area becomes more disrupted.
