**Dione** is the northernmost citadel of [Saturn](<../Saturn.md>). Its guild focuses on philosophy and psychology. The territory of Dione includes the citadel itself, a town, an oracle, and an observatory.

## Observatory
The Dione Observatory stands north of the town. Long ago, it was a star temple for a religion lost to time. After [The Shattering](<../../Events/The Shattering.md>), [Avia](<../../Characters/Avia.md>) had it converted into a star observatory. She currently resides there.
