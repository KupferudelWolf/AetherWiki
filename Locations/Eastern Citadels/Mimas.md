**Mimas** is a central [citadel](<../Citadel.md>) in [Saturn](<../Saturn.md>), in [{{EAST}}](<../{{EAST}}.md>). It consists of the citadel, the surrounding city, and the mines and land up to [Skygrazer](<../Skygrazer.md>).

The guild in Mimas focuses its studies on math, logic, and computing. It is the founding place of the [Yarpanet](<../../Technology/Yarpanet.md>), and it upholds the standards necessary to keep Yarpanet running.
