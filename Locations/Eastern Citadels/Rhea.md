**Rhea** is a southern [citadel](<../Citadel.md>) of [Saturn](<../Saturn.md>), located in [Serra](<../Serra.md>), northeast of [Titan](<./Titan.md>). The citadel itself is physically the second largest in Saturn, only smaller than Titan.

A lot of Saturn's manufacturing industry relies on Rhea. The land outside of the citadel's village is heavily industrialized wherever the land is suitable enough for construction.

Rhea's guild is specialized in natural sciences, such as physics and chemistry. Prior to [the fall of Titan](<./Titan.md#Disaster>), Rhea specifically focused on non-biological natural sciences.

## Geography
Rhea is situated at the top of a sharp mountain. The accompanying village is further down the mountain on smoother ground, forming a ring around the citadel when seen from above. Outside of the village, the terrain is rocky and lightly forested.
