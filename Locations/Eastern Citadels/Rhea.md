**Rhea** is a southern [citadel](<../Citadel.md>) of [Saturn](<../Saturn.md>) that is located in [Serra](<../Serra.md>), northeast of [Titan](<./Titan.md>).

Rhea's studies are specialized in natural sciences, such as physics and chemistry. Prior to [the fall of Titan](<../Technology/Metamutagen.md#Disaster>), Rhea specifically focused on non-biological natural sciences.

A lot of Saturn's manufacturing industry relies on Rhea. The land outside of the citadel's village is heavily industrialized wherever the land is suitable enough for construction.

## Geography
Rhea is situated at the top of a sharp mountain. The accompanying village is further down the mountain on smoother ground, forming a ring around the citadel when seen from above. Outside of the village, the terrain is rocky and lightly forested.
