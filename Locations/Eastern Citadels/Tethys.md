**Tethys** is a central [citadel](<../Citadel.md>) in [Saturn](<../Saturn.md>), in [{{EAST}}](<../{{EAST}}.md>).

Its guild focuses on engineering and industry. Most factories in Saturn are located between Tethys and [Rhea](<./Rhea.md>), as the two are the biggest contributors to the nation's industrial fields.
