A **citadel** is one of eleven fortified guilds found in [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>). Of these, four belong to [Jupiter](<./Jupiter.md>), and seven belong to [Saturn](<./Saturn.md>). Each citadel has a surrounding town or city that is considered a part of the citadel. Outside of the citadels are usually industrialized, often dedicated to lumber, mining, or agriculture.

Citadels hold major political importance. Each one holds a governing body headed by an **archmaster**.

Every citadel is responsible for progress in science, engineering, and culture, but each citadel has a subject it focuses on.

## Saturn
Saturn's citadels are smaller but more numerous than those of Jupiter. Those citadels and their specialties are listed below, from north to south:
- In (NORTH):
	- [Dione](<./Eastern Citadels/Dione.md>): philosophy and psychology
	- [Enceladus](<./Eastern Citadels/Enceladus.md>): arts and culture
- In (EAST):
	- [Mimas](<./Eastern Citadels/Mimas.md>): math, logic, and computing
	- [Iapetus](<./Eastern Citadels/Iapetus.md>): statistics and probability
	- [Tethys](<./Eastern Citadels/Tethys.md>): engineering and industry
- In [Serra](<./Serra.md>):
	- [Rhea](<./Eastern Citadels/Rhea.md>): physical natural sciences
	- [Titan](<./Eastern Citadels/Titan.md>): biological natural sciences

Titan is no longer in service. As a result, Rhea focuses on biological natural sciences as well.

## Jupiter
Jupiter's citadels are considerably larger than those of Saturn, though there are ultimately fewer. Those citadels and their specialties are listed below, from north to south:
- In (NORTH):
	- [Callisto](<./Western Citadels/Callisto.md>): service industries
- In (WEST):
	- [Ganymede](<./Western Citadels/Ganymede.md>): manufacturing industries
	- [Europa](<./Western Citadels/Europa.md>): agricultural industries
	- [Io](<./Western Citadels/Io.md>): extraction industries
