The **Serra** is a mountain range that which roughly splits [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>) in half. The northernmost and tallest mountain, [Skygrazer](<./Skygrazer.md>), contains the [Cirrolite Core](<./Cirrolite Core.md>).

The Serra (except for Skygrazer) is the domain of [Jaki](<../Characters/Jaki.md>).
