**Serra** is a mountain range that which roughly splits [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>) in half, and the southern quadrant of [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>) in which the mountain range is located. The northernmost and tallest mountain, [Skygrazer](<./Skygrazer.md>), contains the [Cirrolite Core](<./Cirrolite Core.md>). Although the Serra range includes Skygrazer, the region of Serra excludes it.

The region of Serra is the domain of [Jaki](<../Characters/Jaki.md>). 

## Citadels
Serra is split between [Saturn](<../Saturn.md>) and [Jupiter](<../Jupiter.md>), but only Saturn has [citadels](<./Citadel.md>) there. Of those citadels, only [Rhea](<./Eastern Citadels/Rhea.md>) is in service, as [Titan](<./Eastern Citadels/Titan.md>) has been mostly abandoned due to a [disaster](<./Eastern Citadels/Titan.md#Disaster>) and the citadels proximity to the [Shifting Lands](<./Shifting Lands.md>).
