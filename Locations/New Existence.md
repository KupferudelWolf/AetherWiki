**New Existence** is the hypothetical region outside of the [Shifting Lands](<./Shifting Lands.md>) in which ripples from [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>) have subsided. The physics are assumed to be vastly different and unsurvivable for all known life.

[Fae](<../Ã†ther/Fae.md>) are in disagreement over whether New Existence currently exists or will exist in the future: whether the ripples from The Shattering have subsided anywhere in the universe. At least, New Existence is the end result of The Shattering, ultimately including [Luxtia](<./Luxtia.md>).

Scientists generally agree, however, that many physical processes, including biology, will be substantially different in New Existence.
