**Myla of the Heat** is one of the four [ætherwolves](<../Æther/Ætherwolf.md>). Legends say she can only be seen in perfect reflections. [{{WEST}}](<../Locations/{{WEST}}.md>) is her domain.

## Appearance
Myla is a white [wolf](<../Æther/Body.md#Wolf>) with round cyan markings on her pelt. Her eyes are also cyan, as are the illusionary "wings" on her back.
