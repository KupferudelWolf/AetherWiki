**Illuna** is an adult [fox](<../Species/Fox.md>).

## Body
Lunathros is a very brightly white [fae](<../Fae.md>) with dark and light blue markings. She has four paws. Her eyes are a bright cyan and have narrow pupils. She has prominent whiskers of average length, and she has somewhat long upper canines that protrude from her mouth.

She tends to wear leather bags around her neck, body, and rump. Various trinkets dangle from her bags. She wears a thin, light, transparent cowl over her neck and chest.

In moonlight, her fur appears to sparkle.

## Spark
Illuna is naive and dramy. She has a passing interest in many things; she easily gets passionate about new or interesting topics. She is quite spiritual and very interested in the occult.

She feels very lost and out-of-place; she wants most to find a place where she feels she belongs.

She can occasionally be moody, though she is practically never angry. She has periodic depressive episodes where she feels alone and hopeless. Usually, being with friends helps her, but when she is feeling depressed, she fears reaching out would somehow upset or inconvenience her friends.
