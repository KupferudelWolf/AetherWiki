**Illuna** is an adult [fox](<../Æther/Body.md#Fox>).

## Body
Illuna is a very bright white [fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>) with blue markings. She has four paws. Her eyes are a bright cyan and have narrow pupils. She has prominent whiskers of average length, and her upper canines visibly protrude from her mouth.

She tends to wear leather bags around her neck, body, and rump. Various trinkets dangle from her bags. She wears a thin, light, transparent cowl over her neck and chest.

In moonlight, her fur appears to sparkle.

## Spark
Illuna is naive and dreamy. She has a passing interest in many things; she easily gets passionate about new or interesting topics. She is quite spiritual and very interested in the occult. However, she is headstrong about her own beliefs.

She feels very lost and out-of-place.

She can occasionally be moody. She has periodic depressive episodes where she feels alone and hopeless. Usually, being with friends helps her, but when she is feeling depressed, she fears reaching out would somehow upset or inconvenience her friends.

Illuna is not easy to anger. When angered, she acts rashly, almost instinctively trying to stop whatever it was that made her mad.

## Backstory
Illuna is from a small and isolated town outside of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>). As a faeling, Illuna was very attached to her parents. She has no siblings.

She, her parents, and every other fae in the town followed an old and very spiritual religion passed down through generations. It revolved around an idea fairly common in religions: that the stars in the night sky are [sparks](<../Æther/Spark.md>). The town's residence believed that a fae gains everlasting life in the night sky when their [body](<../Æther/Body.md>) dies. These celestial sparks would shine brighter if the fae led a virtuous life. However, if a spark were forgotten by all living fae, it would fall from the sky as a shooting star.

As Illuna grew, her parents applied her to a guild in Luxtia; they wanted the best early education for her. Despite the competition, she was one of the few fae selected. Though her parents were excited, Illuna was apprehensive of leaving home.

While she was in Luxtia, [the Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>) occurred, destroying her home. Despite this, Illuna continues to believe she can somehow go home, even though she acknowledges that it's been destroyed.
