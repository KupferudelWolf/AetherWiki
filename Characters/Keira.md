**Keira** is an adult [enfield](<../Species/Enfield.md>). She has a keen interest in archaeology. 

## Body
Keira is a medium-sized [fae](<../Fae.md>) with an intricate brown, grey, and orange pelt. She has talons in the front and paws in the back. Her feathers are a very dark but iridescent bluish-black. She is fairly fit. Her talons are somewhat thick. She has large feathers attached to her mostly furry front legs, long feathers on her rump, and small feathers down the top of her tail. Her eyes are yellow and have narrow pupils. She has prominent whiskers.

She doesn't wear much beyond the occasional necklace or bag.

## Spark
Keira is intelligent, talkative, and eager. She is quick to jump to conclusions or make assumptions, though in general, her intuition serves her well. She habitatually correct others when they say something she knows to be inaccurate. This results in her being overly honest when unnecessary; she is so bad at white lies that other critters can't make them around her.

In debate, she hates being wrong and will defend herself or make excuses when something she says doesn't like up. She is self-conscious about this, though, and will usually try to apologize or admit her mistake later.

Keira enjoys sports, especially climbing.
