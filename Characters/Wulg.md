**Wulg of the Cold** is one of the four [ætherwolves](<../Æther/Ætherwolf.md>). [{{EAST}}](<../Locations/{{EAST}}.md>) is her domain.

Wulg has ram-like crystal horns made of fluorescent scheelite. They are thus soft and fragile despite their intimidating appearance, though Wulg can easily repair them once damaged.
