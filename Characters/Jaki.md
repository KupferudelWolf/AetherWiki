**Jaki of the Ground** is one of the four [ætherwolves](Wolf.md#Ætherwolf).

## Appearance
Jackie is a large, imposing wolf with incredibly black fur and piercing yellow eyes. She has black feathers on her head and neck, as well as white and silver flowers growing from her neck. She has four paws.

She has enormous wings capable of lifting her in the air despite her large form. Unlike most critters, these wings are detached from her front legs; rather, they are a third set of appendages, which are attached to her back. Her flight is clumsy due to her size, especially during takeoff.

Jaki wears silver earrings, each with three circles representing three moons in syzygy. She often carries a lantern with her. She sometimes wears bags that she conceals beneath her wings.

## Personality
Jaki is quiet, stern, wise, and intelligent. She is highly dedicated to her beliefs and goals. She has a soft spot for hatchlings. She loves to live nomadically, hunting and gathering instead of settling down.
