**Naomi** is an adult [fox](Fox.md). She is happily married to [[Avia]].

## Appearance
Naomi is a small brown and tan fox with grey cheeks. Her tail's tan tip reaches and drags on the ground. She has especially prominent and long whiskers. Her eyes are a dark red and have narrow pupils.

## Personality
Naomi is a clever, shy, and intelligent [fae](Fae.md). She is quiet; when she speaks, she is clear and concise. She hides nervousness and anxiety well around strangers. She is an adept liar, but not a habitual one; she usually only lies to protect herself and others, especially from persecution.

Like her wife, she can be quite jealous of others. Yet, she dislikes having attention.

Every time she sneezes, she disrupts the Ã¦ther, rapidly changing parts of her surroundings to various degrees.
