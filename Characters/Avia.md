**Avia of the Sky** is one of the four [ætherwolves](Wolf.md#Ætherwolf). She is happily married to [[Naomi]].

## Appearance
Avia is a small wolf with long, slightly bowed, lightly-colored horns that run parallel to her body up to her rump. She has four paws. Her fur is black, grey, and white, and her eyes are a brilliant orange, with a matching marking beneath her left eye.

## Personality
Avia is passionate, personable, and optimistic. She especially enjoys chatting with other [fae](Fae.md) at length about topics she is knowledgeable about. She also enjoys debating for the sake of debate, especially over practically pointless issues. She loves to explore and go out to town with others.

However, she can be quite egotistical and envious. She loves to talk about her own experiences. Though she is intelligent, she occasionally overestimates what she knows about things, and though she's not afraid to be wrong, she will try to justify why she was wrong about something.

She is a fairly poor planner, preferring to "go with the flow".
