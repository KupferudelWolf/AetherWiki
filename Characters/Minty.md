**Minty** is a giant who lives alone.

## Appearance
Minty is an enormous [fox](Fox.md) who towers over even houses. She has white, grey, and dark blue fur, and long, prominent whiskers. Her eyes are light cool green with narrow pupils. Even for her size, she is heavy. Her tail is massive; it drags on the ground behind her, creating trails in the forest.
