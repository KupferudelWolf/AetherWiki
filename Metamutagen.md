**Metamutagen** is a viscous black fluid once produced in [[Titan]] that chaotically alters the [body](Body.md) and weakens the [spark](Spark.md).

## Properties
Metamutagen is incredibly dark and somewhat viscous, like oil. It is fairly cohesive, like mercury. It is incredibly conductive of  [æther](Æther.md) perturbations, heat, and electricity.

When a [fae](Fae.md) comes in contact with metamutagen, their body experiences a myriad of seemingly random yet often beneficial or powerful mutations. Their spark, however, shrinks, as the metamutagen pulls it apart layer by layer. Some sparks are completely destroyed, but other sparks can survive if a layer inside resists against the metamutagen.

## Creation
Metamutagen was originally created in [[Titan]] by scientists attempting to create a liquid conductor for æther perturbations.

## Disaster

(water supply, plants, maybe even pollen?)
