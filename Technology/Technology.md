This article covers relatively familiar and mundane technology used by the [fae](<../Fae.md>) of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>). In general, technology in Luxtia resembles Earthly technology from the late 1980s to the early 2000s.

## Computers
In Luxtia, personal computers are rather large and slow, resembling Earthly computers of the late 1990s.

### Personal Computers
Most fae living in the urban regions of the [citadels](<../Locations/Citadel.md>) have a personal computer per household.

PCs are very modular and generally built for many purposes. They often use a trackball (rather than a mouse) but otherwise include the machine itself, a cathode-ray tube monitor for display, and a keyboard. Other peripherals include alternative control devices, scanners, printers, and speakers.

PCs are very modular but seldom purpose-built. Fae often use PCs to communicate with each other through the [Intranet](<./Intranet.md>), to record personal data, to watch or listen to media, and to play computer games.

### Devices
Portable music players are popular in all of Luxtia. Music is stored externally on a cassette or magnetic card, or internally in a disk drive using tracks transferred from a PC. Both devices are small and meant to be worn on the mid-upper part of a foreleg. Headphones clip onto the ear (on the lateral side, near the bottom).

### Research Computers
Citadels use computers to conduct, store, and share experiments. The most powerful computers use bone capacitors to keep [æthereal energy](<../Æther/Energy.md>) at certain points, either to directly test [æther](<../Æther/Æther.md>) or to perform complex computations quicker. The most powerful computer in Luxtia is located in [Mimas](<../Locations/Eastern Citadels/Mimas.md>).

## Data Storage
Digital information in Luxtia is primarily stored in cassettes and magnetic cards and disks (such as hard drives). Optical storage, though present, is not yet popular and generally only used for data storage in [Callisto](<../Locations/Western Citadels/Callisto.md>). A method to store æthereal energy on a medium (without requiring any kind of external power) has not been discovered.

## Video Games & Toys
Arcade machines are rather popular in Luxtia, while personal video game consoles are rare and outdated due to lack of local development.

Portable electronic toys with simple interfaces, display, and electronics are extremely common in the region, however. These toys have a single game; this may be a puzzle game, a virtual pet simulator, or some kind of racing game.
