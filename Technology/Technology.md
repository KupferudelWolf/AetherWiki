This article covers relatively familiar and mundane technology used by the [fae](<../Fae.md>) of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>). In general, technology in Luxtia resembles Earthly technology from the late 1990s or early 2000s.

## Computers

### Personal Computers
In Luxtia, personal computers are rather large and slow, resembling Earthly computers of the late 1990s. Most fae living in the urban regions of the [citadels](<../Locations/Citadel.md>) have at least one personal computer per household.

PCs are very modular and generally built for many purposes. They often use a trackball (rather than a mouse) but otherwise include the machine itself, a cathode-ray tube monitor for display, and a keyboard. Other peripherals include alternative control devices, scanners, printers, and speakers.

PCs are very modular but seldom purpose-built. Fae often use PCs to communicate with each other through the [Intranet](<./Intranet.md>), to record personal data, to watch or listen to media, and to play computer games.

## Video Games & Toys
Arcade machines are rather popular in Luxtia, while personal video game consoles are rare and outdated due to lack of local development.

Portable electronic toys with simple interfaces, display, and electronics are extremely common in the region, however. These toys have a single game; this may be a puzzle game, a virtual pet simulator, or some kind of racing game.
