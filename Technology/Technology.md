This article covers relatively familiar and mundane technology used by the [fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>) of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>). In general, technology in Luxtia resembles Earthly technology from the late 1980s to the early 2000s.

## Computers
In Luxtia, personal computers are rather large and slow, resembling Earthly computers of the late 1990s.

### Personal Computers
Most fae living in the urban regions of the [citadels](<../Locations/Citadel.md>) have one personal computer per household.

PCs are very modular and generally built for many purposes. They often use a trackball (rather than a mouse) but otherwise include the machine itself, a cathode-ray tube monitor for display, and a keyboard. Other peripherals include alternative control devices, scanners, printers, and speakers.

PCs are very modular but seldom purpose-built. Fae often use PCs to communicate with each other through the [Yarpanet](<./Yarpanet.md>), to record personal data, to watch or listen to media, and to play computer games.

### Devices
Portable music players are popular in all of Luxtia. Music is stored externally on a cassette or magnetic card, or internally in a disk drive using tracks transferred from a PC. Both devices are small and meant to be worn on the mid-upper part of a foreleg. Headphones clip onto the ear (on the lateral side, near the bottom).

### Research Computers
Citadels use computers to conduct, store, and share experiments. The most powerful computers use bone capacitors (or even [cirrolite](<./Cirrolite.md>) capacitors) to keep [exergy](<../Æther/Exergy.md>) at certain points, either to directly test [æther](<../Æther/Æther.md>) or to research quantum computing and data storage. The most powerful computer in Luxtia is located in [Mimas](<../Locations/Eastern Citadels/Mimas.md>).

## Data Storage
Digital information in Luxtia is primarily stored in cassettes, magnetic cards, and magnetic disks (such as hard drives). Optical storage, though present, is not yet popular and only used rarely for data storage in [Callisto](<../Locations/Western Citadels/Callisto.md>).

[Exergy](<../Æther/Exergy.md>) can be temporarily recorded in circuitry that incorporates conductive or capacitive materials such as bone and [cirrolite](<./Cirrolite.md>). As with any other kind of quantum computing, this technology is too imprecise to be useful for data storage or computations.

## Video Games & Toys
Arcade machines are rather popular in Luxtia, while personal video game consoles are rare and outdated due to lack of local development.

Portable electronic toys with simple interfaces, display, and electronics are extremely common in the region, however. These toys have a single game; this may be a puzzle game, a virtual pet simulator, or some kind of racing game.
