A **computer** is an electronic machine capable of performing complex calculations quickly. Computers may be used for research, data, communication, or entertainment, and may be built for one or multiple purposes.

## Personal Computers
In [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>), personal computers are still rather large (resembling those of the late 1990s on Earth). Most [fae](<../Fae.md>) living in or near citadels have at least one personal computer per household, but few rural fae do.

Most PCs have four components: the machine itself, often called the tower, chassis, system, or case; a cathode-ray tube monitor for display; a keyboard; and a pointing device or trackball. Other peripherals include alternative control devices, scanners for recording physical documents, printers for creating physical documents, and speakers for playing audio.

PCs are very modular but seldom purpose-built. Fae often use PCs to communicate with each other through the [Intranet](<./Intranet.md>), to record personal data, to watch or listen to media, and to play computer games.

## Video Games & Toys
Fae have several kinds of purpose-built computers for playing games. Some cities have arcades where fae can play games in a public, social setting. Some urban fae have personal video game systems as well.

Most common, though, are portable electronic toys with simple interfaces, display, and electronics.
