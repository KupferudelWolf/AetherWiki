**Cirrolite** is a translucent light-blue crystalline material primarily found in the core of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>). It is an extremely good conductor for [æthereal energy](<../Æther/Energy.md>) and thus [sequencing](<../Æther/Sequencing.md>).

Cirrolite is available in two forms: **isometric** and **prismatic**.

## Mineralogy
Both forms of cirrolite have a hardness of around 9 on the Mohs scale, but is rigid and brittle.

Cirrolite is often micaceous, forming triangular plates when cleaved horizontally. It fractures into sharp conchoidal surfaces that may further splinter into thin needles. It leaves a white streak.

In the core of Luxtia, it forms as druse or massive crystals.

### Isometric Cirrolite
As the name suggests, isometric cirrolite has an isometric structure, forming tetrahedral crystals.

### Prismatic Cirrolite
Prismatic cirrolite is monoclinic. It is chiefly found in the [core](<../Locations/Cirrolite Core.md>) of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>) as large druse crystals in the shape of an elongated tetrahedron. Smaller growths outside of the core are often acicular, usually growing on quartz.

## Æthereal Properties
Cirrolite has strong directionality in the æther and is capable of "storing" [æthereal energy](<../Æther/Energy.md>) by holding a point at an elevated level. This is similar to [bone](<../Æther/Æther.md#Conductance>) but far more effective.

When æther ripples directly perpendicular to one of the four faces of an isometric cirrolite crystal, the energy of these perturbations is stored in the crystal, holding a point of higher energy in the æther. Whenever another face receives æthereal energy, the crystal becomes a conductor, conducting the energy from each face to their opposite points. Stored energy is released first and evenly between the points, after which the output energy is equal to the average of the input energy.

As a result, cirrolite can operate as both a capacitor and a transistor for æthereal energy. A crystal's resistance and rise time correlate mostly with its shape, while capacitance correlates more with its size.

Prismatic cirrolite can work similar, but due to its elongated prism-like shape, it can only direct energy vertically and cannot discharge its stored energy nearly as quickly. Natural prismatic cirrolite growths tend to store great amounts of energy in itself or the isometric cirrolite growths at its base, or releasing it through its tip.

Isolated prismatic cirrolite work are incredible (albeit fragile) conductors.
