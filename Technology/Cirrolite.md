**Cirrolite** is a translucent light-blue crystalline material primarily found in the core of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>). It is an extremely good conductor of [exergy](<../Æther/Exergy.md>) and thus [sequencing](<../Æther/Sequencing.md>).

Cirrolite has two forms: **isometric** and **prismatic**.

## Physical Properties
Cirrolite is a phosphate porphyrin(?) similar to hydroxyapatite, which is found in [bones](<../Æther/Æther.md#Conductance>). Both forms of cirrolite have a hardness of around 9 on the Mohs scale, but is rigid and brittle.

Cirrolite is highly anisotropic. On its cleavage plane, cirrolite is often micaceous, forming triangular plates when cleaved horizontally. It fractures into sharp conchoidal surfaces that may further splinter into thin needles. It leaves a white streak.

In the core of Luxtia, it forms as druse or massive crystals.

### Isometric Cirrolite
As the name suggests, isometric cirrolite has an isometric structure, forming tetrahedral crystals.

### Prismatic Cirrolite
Prismatic cirrolite is chiefly found in the [core](<../Locations/Cirrolite Core.md>) of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>) as large druse crystals in the shape of an elongated tetrahedron. Smaller growths outside of the core are often needle-shaped (acicular), often growing on quartz. Similar to [ulexite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulexite) (though not nearly as impressive), individual needles can act like optical fibers.

## Æthereal Properties
Cirrolite is capable of "storing" [exergy](<../Æther/Exergy.md>) by holding a point at an elevated level. This is similar to [bone](<../Æther/Æther.md#Conductance>) but far more effective.

When æther ripples directly perpendicular to one of the four faces of an isometric cirrolite crystal, the exergy of these perturbations is stored in the crystal, holding a point of higher exergy in the æther. Whenever another face receives exergy, the crystal becomes a conductor, conducting the exergy from each face to their opposite points. Stored exergy is released first and evenly between the points, after which the output exergy is equal to the average of the input exergy.

As a result, cirrolite can operate as either a capacitor or a transistor for exergy. A crystal's resistance and rise time correlate mostly with its shape, while capacitance correlates more with its size.

Prismatic cirrolite can work similar, but due to its elongated prism-like shape, it can only direct exergy vertically and cannot discharge its stored exergy nearly as quickly. Natural prismatic cirrolite growths tend to store great amounts of exergy in itself or the isometric cirrolite growths at its base, or releasing it through its tip.

Isolated prismatic cirrolite work are incredible (albeit fragile) conductors.
