**Metamutagen** is an organic black fluid once produced in [Titan](<../Locations/Eastern Citadels/Titan.md>) that chaotically alters the [body](<../Æther/Body.md>) and weakens the [spark](<../Æther/Spark.md>).

## Properties
Metamutagen is dark and somewhat viscous, like crude oil. It is fairly cohesive, like mercury. It is incredibly conductive of [exergy](<../Æther/Exergy.md>) and thus energy.

When a [body](<../Æther/Body.md>) comes in contact with metamutagen, it experiences a myriad of seemingly random yet often powerful mutations at all points of contact. If the body has a spark, the metamutagen pulls it apart layer by layer. Most sparks are completely [destroyed](<../Phenomena/Death.md>), but some sparks can survive if a layer inside happens to resists against the metamutagen. Such sparks remain further invulnerable to metamutagen, though new layers may still be torn off.

A metamutagen-poisoned [fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>) will have far less willpower and a lower mood than before due to their weakened spark. Most likely, their spark will have deteriorated to the point that they are mostly passive. A poisoned fae can recover over time simply by refraining from contacting metamutagen and rebuilding their spark.

Metamutagen is also carcinogenic; it is directly linked to bone cancer.

## Creation
Metamutagen was originally created at [Titan](<../Locations/Eastern Citadels/Titan.md>) by scientists attempting to create a liquid conductor for [æther perturbations](<../Æther/Exergy.md>).
