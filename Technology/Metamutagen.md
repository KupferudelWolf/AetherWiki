**Metamutagen** is a viscous black fluid once produced in [Titan](<../Locations/Eastern Citadels/Titan.md>) that chaotically alters the [body](<../Æther/Body.md>) and weakens the [spark](<../Æther/Spark.md>).

## Properties
Metamutagen is incredibly dark and somewhat viscous, like oil. It is fairly cohesive, like mercury. It is incredibly conductive of [energy](<../Æther/Energy.md>) and thus heat and electricity.

When a [body](<../Æther/Body.md>) comes in contact with metamutagen, it experiences a myriad of seemingly random yet often powerful mutations. If the body has a spark, the metamutagen pulls it apart layer by layer. Some sparks are completely [destroyed](<../Phenomena/Death.md>), but other sparks can survive if a layer inside happens to resists against the metamutagen. Such sparks remain invulnerable to metamutagen, though new layers may still be torn off.

[Fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>) whose sparks survive metamutagen almost always have a much weaker spark.

## Creation
Metamutagen was originally created at [Titan](<../Locations/Eastern Citadels/Titan.md>) by scientists attempting to create a liquid conductor for [æther perturbations](<../Æther/Energy.md>).
