**Excavators** are [fae](<../Æther/Fae.md>) specifically trained to explore the Shifting Lands and finding rare materials. Excavating is dangerous, so excavators use both their skills and advanced technology to protect themselves and acquire rare resources.

The [Shifting Lands](<../Locations/Shifting Lands.md>) is the chaotic region outside of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>). The unpredictability of the region can result in abnormal materials that would otherwise be difficult to create or obtain, even with the use of [sequencing](<../Æther/Sequencing.md>).

## Structure
Excavators work in a **crew** of four. A single crew excavates once every 4 or 8 days. Crews are officially numbered in order of creation, though many also assign unofficial nicknames to themselves.

## Beacons
A **beacon** is a device that uses a large [cirrolite](<./Cirrolite.md>) crystal to keep the æther stable within a small region.
