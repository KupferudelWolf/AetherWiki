An **osteoaugment**, or simply **augment**, is a device that attaches to a [fae's](<../Æther/Fae.md>) bone.

Augments are usually worn on an **interface**: an artificial external port that involves a conductive rod (often made of bone or [cirrolite](<./Cirrolite.md>)) connected to the wearer's bone (toward the front of the zygomatic arch). The port includes at least two opposing magnets, plus a membrane or cover for protection.

Quadrupedal fae attach augments to their interface by holding it in a paw and rubbing it against their head until the magnets grab. They detach the augment by kicking it off with a hind paw.

## Operation
Because an augment connects directly to the skeleton, it interacts with the fae's [aura](<../Æther/Aura.md>) and allows their [spark](<../Æther/Spark.md>) to more easily interact with the device.

Most augments are controlled by manipulating the [æther](<../Æther/Æther.md>) to change the state of the circuit. The devices are built to expect changes in a broad area, since [sequencing](<../Æther/Sequencing.md>) at a micron or even millimeter scale is exceedingly difficult for most fae. Thus, must devices have only one or two inputs that a fae can interact with.

Many devices are charged with or powered by the wearer's spark. Most commonly, the spark creates an electric field by creating an imbalance in charges, which loads capacitors in a Marx generator until it triggers a relay to power the rest of the circuit.

## Functions
Osteoaugments come in a variety of forms and functions. Simpler augments include radios and speakers that play audio through directional speakers. Visors may cup over an eye and rest on the muzzle. Very simple controllers can interact with computers, though their bandwidth is limited to a few bits.

Augments can also directly aid in [sequencing](<../Æther/Sequencing.md>). The simplest augment is a conductive, often forward-facing point; this extends the wearer's aura forward to a sharp point, allowing them to [focus](<../Æther/Focusing.md>) more precisely. Similar augments can facilitate in [resolving](<../Æther/Resolving.md>).

## Alternative Form Factors
Most augments are manufactured to be used with interfaces. However, specialized augments can attach to horns or teeth. Though the aural connection is weaker, it may still be sufficient for certain types of devices.

## Slang
"Augment" and "interface" is sometimes used among faeling as a vulgar or immature euphemism for sexual acts. This is especially common on [LOL](<./Luxtia On-Line.md>) between fae in petty arguments. For example, a fae may try to anger another by claiming they will "augment" (or have previously "augmented") the other fae's mother despite having no intentions of actually doing so.

Adult fae using this slang, especially to refer to actual intercourse, is seen by faelings and adults alike as nerdy, ostentatious, or simply rude.
