The **aura** is the superpositional orbit of a [spark](<./Spark.md>). This aura typically envelops and surrounds the [body](<./Body.md>). The volume increases with the spark’s power.

The spark is a part of the [æther](<./Æther.md>), so a spark’s aura is extended by bone and reduced by skin and fur. Fae with horns or otherwise exposed bone (even through injury) typically have a greater aura.

A [fae](<../Fae.md>) can [focus](<./Focusing.md>) their spark anywhere within their aura.
