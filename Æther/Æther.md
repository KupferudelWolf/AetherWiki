The **æther** is a physical field that influences randomness and entropy. It is a measure of [exergy](<./Exergy.md>) and essentially determines how things progress through time. The æther interacts with everything, and everything interacts with the æther; all physical interactions in the universe operate through the æther.

## Ground State
The total absolute exergy in the universe only reduces with time. It thus approaches a **ground state** of effectively zero exergy.

## Axes
Each infinitesimal point in the æther describes an amount of "workable" or "available" energy. This [exergy](<./Exergy.md>) is usually measured relative to the ambient level, which itself is compared to the ground state (which dropped after [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>)). Each point is described as a vector, the magnitude of which describes the total exergy at that point.

The two axes were arbitrarily named according to a more classical understanding of the physics behind sequencing; each axis’s positive and negative signs are named one of four elements. The axes are:
- The **ground-sky** axis. The ground element refers to a positive magnitude, and the sky element refers to a negative magnitude. Electromagnetism is associated with this field; areas of high positive electrical charge are also high in the ground element, but fluctuations in the other axis can still affect the electromagnetic field.
- The **warm-cold** (or fyr-is?) axis. The warm element refers to a positive magnitude, and the cold element refers to a negative magnitude. This axis may correspond to thermodynamic properties (including temperature), but fluctuations in the other axis can still affect these properties.

The æther is continuous; individual objects do not have their own vector fields, but rather occupy the æther as they do in physical space. Thus, any object has an infinite number of any four “elements”; it may have positive and negative magnitudes in the same axis at different points of this vector field. The æther as a whole is rather chaotic; it rapidly changes and appears unpredictable. However, it is ultimately subjected to the laws of thermodynamics: the æther is always progressing to a higher state of entropy (equilibrium) as it approaches the ground state. Additionally, creation of exergy requires equal or greater destruction of exergy within the system; entropy cannot be reduced.

## Conductance
[Exergy](<./Exergy.md>) propagates at varying speeds. Most notably, it moves faster through bone and [cirrolite](<../Technology/Cirrolite.md>), and slower through keratin.

Bone's conductance is due in part to its structure and in part to its composition, with hydroxyapatite being a core factor. Living and dead bone have no significant difference in conductance. Bone is very often used to facilitate changes or hold a charge in the field in components ranging from bone wands to bone capacitors. Meanwhile, fur is often used to protect systems from external changes.

Any living being with bones can sense exergy. Horns, teeth, and bone tools strengthen this sense.

## Force Carrier
[Fae](<./Fae.md>) currently debate over whether the æther has force-carrying particles, or if exergy moves through wave-like [wind](<./Wind.md>).
