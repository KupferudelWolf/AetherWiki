**Sequencing** is the intentional use of a [spark](<./Spark.md>) to manipulate the [æther](<./Æther.md>). A spark can "tug" at areas of the æther within its [aura](<./Aura.md>); this changes how points in that area proceed through time. Changes may thus take time; only strong or highly focused sparks can cause apparently immediate changes in the environment.

A [fae](<../Fae.md>) can **focus** their spark in a specific part of its aura in order to improve their ability to sequence.

Most fae do not know how the æther works; to a fae, sequencing feels like focusing hard on something and mentally picturing how it can change.

As sequencing cannot defy the laws of thermodynamics, changes in energy in one area in the æther will need an opposite change in another.
