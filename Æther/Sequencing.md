**Sequencing** is the intentional use of a [spark](<./Spark.md>) to manipulate the [æther](<./Æther.md>). A spark can "tug" at areas of the æther within its [aura](<./Aura.md>). This creates imbalances in the æther, changing [exergy](<./Exergy.md>) to cause a desired effect.

A [fae](<./Fae.md>) can [focus](<./Focusing.md>) their spark in a specific part of their aura in order to improve their ability to sequence.

Most fae do not know how the æther works; to a fae, sequencing feels like focusing hard on something and mentally picturing how it can change.

## Precision
Most fae can comfortably sequence within a volume of a few cubic centimeters inside of their aura. Larger or smaller scales become exponentially more difficult. More "powerful" sparks may be able to manipulate a range from a cubic millimeter to a few cubic meters.

Fae can more easily sequence when they [focus](<./Focusing.md>). Focusing is easier when done on a target object.
