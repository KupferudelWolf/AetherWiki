**Sequencing** is the intentional use of a [spark](<./Spark.md>) to manipulate the [æther](<./Æther.md>). A spark can "tug" at areas of the æther within its [aura](<./Aura.md>). This creates imbalances in the æther, manipulating [exergy](<./Exergy.md>) to cause a desired effect.

A [fae](<./Fae.md>) can [focus](<./Focusing.md>) their spark in a specific part of their aura in order to improve their ability to sequence.

Most fae do not know how the æther works; to a fae, sequencing feels like focusing hard on something and mentally picturing how it can change.

As sequencing cannot defy the laws of thermodynamics, changes in exergy in one area in the æther will need an equal but opposite change nearby.

## Precision
Most fae can comfortably sequence within a volume of a few cubic centimeters inside of their aura. Larger or smaller scales become exponentially more difficult. More "powerful" sparks may be able to manipulate a range from a cubic millimeter to a few cubic meters.

Fae can more easily sequence when they [focus](<./Focusing.md>). Focusing is easier when done on a target object.
