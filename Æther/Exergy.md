**Exergy** refers to perturbations and imbalances in the [æther](<./Æther.md>). Regions of higher exergy are further from the ground state, with stronger charges in each of every point's axes.

Exergy is identical to the eponymous thermodynamic concept; it describes the "available energy" within a system.

When exergy is "created" in a region, such as through [sequencing](<./Sequencing.md>), equal but opposing exergy increases in its surroundings. In other words, exergy isn't truly created, but rather moved from one region to another.
