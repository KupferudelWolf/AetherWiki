**Exergy** refers to perturbations and imbalances in the [æther](<./Æther.md>). Regions of higher exergy are further from the ground state, with stronger charges in each of every point's axes.

Exergy is identical to the eponymous thermodynamic concept; it describes the "available energy" within a system.

When exergy is created, such as through [sequencing](<./Sequencing.md>), an equal or greater amount of exergy must be destroyed. Thus, exergy can only decrease with time as entropy increases.
