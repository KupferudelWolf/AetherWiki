**Exergy** is the amount of "workable" energy in a system. Regions of higher exergy are further from the ground state, with stronger charges in each of every point's axes.

When exergy is created, such as through [sequencing](<./Sequencing.md>), an equal or greater amount of exergy must be destroyed. Thus, exergy can only decrease with time as entropy increases.
