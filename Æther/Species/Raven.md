A **raven** (specifically, the common raven) is a small avian animal. It is the only non-mammalian animal to be capable of being a fae. It has a plumage of iridescent black feathers and a fairly thick beak.

## Body
Sparkless raven [bodies](<../Body.md>) are adaptable and incredibly intelligent, capable of creating and using tools even without a [spark](<../Spark.md>). They are somewhat territorial but may travel in flocks. They can eat insects and small seeds or fruit, but they are more often seen feeding on carrion.

## Fae
The fact ravens can have sparks is unusual, as all other [fae](<../Fae.md>) have mammalian bodies. The close relationship between ravens and [wolves](<./Wolf.md>), and the species' spectacular intelligence, may have contributed to this.

Raven stereotypes are split, especially among their wolf brethren. They may be viewed as smart and prepared, or annoying and snarky.
