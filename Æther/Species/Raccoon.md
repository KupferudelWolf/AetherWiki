A **raccoon** is a small musteloid animal. It has a wide face and stout build. It is easy to recognize by its mask-like face markings and ringed tail. Its front paws are incredibly dexterous, allowing it to manipulate tools much better than most other fae. They are also capable of a bipedal stance, at least for a moment.

## Body
Raccoon [bodies](<../Body.md>) are clever and adaptable. They are not picky about what they eat; they can eat a broad range of food. They are curious and interact mostly with touch; they will touch, scrape, and pick up novel items to investigate them. They communicate with chittering sounds. They are most active at night.

## Fae
Raccoons are technically not native to [Luxtia](<../../Locations/Luxtia.md>), but rather to a region formally neighboring it to the south. So, even before [The Shattering](<../../Events/The Shattering.md>), raccoon-bodied [fae](<../Fae.md>) had a common permanent presence in Luxtia.

With their extreme dexterity, raccoon fae often worked more precise jobs, especially in manufacturing.

Raccoons are stereotypically seen as, and often particular expected to be, clever. Some larger fae perceive them as silly. They are also seen as very physically weak.
