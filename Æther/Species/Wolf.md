A **wolf** (specifically, the grey wolf) is a large canine animal. It has a broad snout, round ears, a thick neck, and two layers of fur. It has a strong bite and good endurance.

## Body
Without a [spark](<../Spark.md>), wolf [bodies](<../Body.md>) are cooperative and social, yet extremely territorial. They prefer to stick to groups (or "packs"), which usually consists of a wolf pair and their children, though younger wolves may leave this group to start their own. They are known for their loud prolonged "howl", which they use to find and bond with wolves in their pack, and to keep other wolves away. They prefer to eat meat, either from hunting or scavenging.

## Fae
Wolf-bodied [fae](<../Fae.md>) are common in [Luxtia](<../../Locations/Luxtia.md>) and have been present in the region for a long time. In fact, wolves are believed to have acquired sparks earlier than any other species currently capable of having a spark.

Wolves are stronger but less dexterous than most other species in Luxtia. As a result, they historically have fulfilled physically laborious roles.

As the name implies, all four [ætherwolves](<../Ætherwolf.md>) are wolves.

Stereotypes around wolves may portray them positively as physically strong, responsible, or wise; or negatively as clumsy, pretentious, or stubborn.
