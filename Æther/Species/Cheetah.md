A **cheetah** is a large feline animal. It has long legs, a lithe build, a small head, and typically spotted fur. It is incredibly quick, capable of running faster than any other animal in [Luxtia](<../../Locations/Luxtia.md>).

## Body
Without a [spark](<../Spark.md>), cheetah [bodies](<../Body.md>) are careful and fairly territorial. Unlike many other predators in Luxtia, cheetahs are more active in the day. They often meow, purr, growl, and chitter. They may be nomadic until they find the ideal place to settle down, and they may settle down on their own or in groups. Like other felines, they hunt by stalking as close as they can before giving chase.

Cheetahs (as well as [hyenas](<./Hyena.md>)) are native to a former land that was far warmer than [Luxtia](<../../Locations/Luxtia.md>). Local cheetahs have adapted to the cold, growing longer pelts.

## Fae
Cheetah-bodied [fae](<../Fae.md>) are rare in Luxtia; they are mostly fae who were visiting Luxtia when [The Shattering](<../../Events/The Shattering.md>) occurred, or descendants thereof.

In Luxtia, cheetahs are seen as mysterious. They are both rare and secluded, so most fae know little about them. [Hyenas](<./Hyena.md>) are more familiar with them, however, and see them as rivals.
