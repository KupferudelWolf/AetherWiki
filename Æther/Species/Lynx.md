A **lynx** (specifically, the Canadian lynx) is a medium feline animal. It has a short snout, pointy ears with sharp tufts, enormous paws with retractable claws, and a short tail. It is lean with a small head. Its legs are thick, with its hind legs longer than its front legs.

## Body
Lynx [bodies](<../Body.md>) without a [spark](<../Spark.md>) are solitary and mobile. They can swim, climb, and run well in any kind of environment within Luxtia. They avoid other animals, preferring to stay completely alone. Instead of chasing their prey, lynxes will hide and wait near where their prey tends to travel. They especially love to eat hare; besides some other meats, they will not (and often cannot) eat anything else.

## Fae
Since they are native to [Luxtia](<../../Locations/Luxtia.md>), lynx-bodied [fae](<../Fae.md>) are common. Like a sparkless lynx body, these fae tend to keep to themselves. Most lynx fae are introverted.

Stereotypes around lynx fae thus revolve around this introversion. They are also seen as secluded and quiet.
