A **fox** is a small canine animal. It has a narrow and pointed snout, sharp ears, and a considerably bushy tail. Its pelt may be all black, all white, or colorful. It is more flexible and adaptable than other canines and may even have retractable claws.

## Body
Sparkless fox [bodies](<../Body.md>) tend to be solitary. They are quick and agile enough to throw off anyone trying to follow them. They have complex vocalizations, including howls, whines, barks, screams, and more. They will eat anything they can, though some will prefer specific foods over others. They are known to bury food for later.

Several fox species are common in [Luxtia](<../../Locations/Luxtia.md>), including the colorful red fox, the dexterous grey fox, and the highly adapted arctic fox.

## Fae
Fox-bodied [fae](<../Fae.md>) are the most common in [Luxtia](<../../Locations/Luxtia.md>) due to their physical adaptability.

Stereotypes around foxes vary between species. They tend to be viewed as louder and more energetic. [Wolves](<./Wolf.md>) in particular may find them strange but endearing.
