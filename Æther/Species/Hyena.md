A **hyena** is a medium animal. It has a very broad snout, a sloped back, and a thick neck. Though it resembles canines and felines, it is neither. It often has a patterned pelt, and it may have longer hairs along its dorsal side. It has an incredibly strong bite, but it lacks flexibility.

## Body
Hyena [bodies](<../Body.md>) are very opportunistic. They tend to keep alone; when they group up, they often fight with each other. Some vocalize with whooping howls and laugh-like barks, while others are silent. They prefer meat, which they may hunt for or scavenge.

## Fae
Hyenas are not native to [Luxtia](<../../Locations/Luxtia.md>) and are very rare. Most hyena [fae](<../Fae.md>) in Luxtia were visiting the region during [The Shattering](<../../Events/The Shattering.md>). They come from the same region as [cheetahs](<./Cheetah.md>).

Despite their rarity, hyena fae still have stereotypes. Stereotypical hyenas are hot-headed, rash, or unfocused. They are associated with cheetahs, who they usually view as rivals.
