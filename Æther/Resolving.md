A [spark](<./Spark.md>) is **resolved** when its superposition is collapsed to a discrete point, and **diffused** otherwise. A resolved spark is far better at [sequencing](<./Sequencing.md>); it can cause extreme changes in [æthereal energy](<./Energy.md>) that even the strongest sparks would be incapable of doing otherwise. However, a resolved spark is extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in the æther, both natural wind and malicious attacks.

A resolved spark appears as a bright point of white light. Sparks of higher power may hurt to look at. Its aura is limited in how large and small it can be while resolved; the average limits are a between 3 cm and 20 cm, with the minimum decreasing and the maximum increasing with the spark’s power.

A [fae](<../Fae.md>) requires [focus](<./Focusing.md>) to resolve or diffuse a spark, but they do not need to keep focus to keep a spark in either state. A fae can be forced to resolve their spark through sequencing; this is called **collapsing**. When a fae’s body dies, their spark collapses.

A resolved spark is detached from the body. It can move itself, and it can be moved completely independently of a body. Fluctuations in the æther can move it too, much like wind.

A spark cannot diffuse into a body that already has a spark.
