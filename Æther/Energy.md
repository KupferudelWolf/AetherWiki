**Æthereal energy** refers to perturbations and imbalances in the [æther](<./Æther.md>). Regions of higher energy are further from equilibrium, with stronger charges in every point's axes.

The **wind** of the æther is the random noise of lower energy present in all of the æther. It influences the direction that energy dissipates (as it will naturally dissipate into regions with the greatest difference in energy) and thus its "direction".

When energy is "created" in a region, such as through [sequencing](<./Sequencing.md>), energy of equal but opposing charge increases in its surroundings. In other words, energy isn't truly created, but rather "pushed" from one region to another. The only known exception is [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>), in which a change in the equilibrium caused an effective change in energy.
