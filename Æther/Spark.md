The **spark** is a particle that contains a [fae’s](<../Fae.md>) "essence" or "soul". It is their morality, their personality, their superego.

Every fae's consciousness is a result of the combination of a spark and a body. If the spark and body are separated, neither are conscious. Both are acting like an automata, with the body working on instinct, and the spark working on personality and identity. Neither are experiencing, but upon reuniting (or upon uniting with a different body or spark), the fae receives memories of experiencing everything as though they were in both places at once, their "ego" filling in the gaps. It is in a sense a very similar experience to dreaming.

## Physical Properties
The spark is a complex organism consisting of particle-like topological defects in the æther. It exists in superposition within its [aura](<./Aura.md>).

A spark grows more complex over time. A spark’s power denotes how large and complex, and thus powerful, it is. Self-fulfilling actions, personality growth, and wisdom can cause a spark to grow faster, though only external æthereal disruptions (such as another fae maliciously sequencing a resolved spark) can reverse growth. Typically, an older or more experienced spark is more powerful than a younger, naive spark.

A spark produces very faint, usually imperceivable light. This light is brighter while the spark is [focused](<./Focusing.md>). When [resolved](<./Resolving.md>), it can even be too bright to look at.
