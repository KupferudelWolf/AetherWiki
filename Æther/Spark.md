The **spark** is a pseudoparticle that contains a [fae's](<./Fae.md>) "essence" or "soul". It provides them their morality and personality: their superego.

Every fae's consciousness is a result of the combination of a spark and a body. In a physical sense, the spark unlocks functions in the brain that allow for a higher state of [consciousness](<../Phenomena/Consciousness.md>). If the spark and body are [separated](<./Resolving.md>), this functionality is lost, and neither are conscious. Both are acting like an automata, with the body working on instinct, and the spark working on personality and identity. Neither are experiencing, but upon [reuniting](<./Diffusing.md>) (or upon uniting with a different body or spark), the fae receives [memories](<../Phenomena/Memory.md>) of experiencing everything as though they were in both places at once, their "ego" filling in the gaps. To a fae, this feels like a very similar experience to [dreaming](<../Phenomena/Sleeping & Dreaming.md>).

## Physical Properties
The spark is a complex organism consisting of a quasiparticle of topological defects in the [æther](<./Æther.md>). It exists in superposition within its [aura](<./Aura.md>).

A spark produces very faint, usually imperceivable light. This light is brighter while the spark is [focused](<./Focusing.md>). When [resolved](<./Resolving.md>), it can even be too bright to look at.

## Power
The **power** of a spark, which can be physically measured by its complexity and size, determines how rapidly it can affect the æther. Simply being diffused within a body strengthens a spark enough to negate its natural decay, though a resolved spark can be weakened if damaged.

A fae can strengthen their spark by attending to their needs. [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) is a decent model to determine how well a fulfilled need may strengthen a spark; physical needs like food and water are just enough to stave off natural forces that otherwise weaken sparks, while intimacy, achievement, and self-actualization strengthen a spark much more.
