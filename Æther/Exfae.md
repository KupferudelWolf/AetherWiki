An **exfae** is a [fae](<./Fae.md>) allegedly sighted from within the [Shifting Lands](<../Locations/Shifting Lands.md>). Their existence is unconfirmed and often considered a hoax.

Exfae are always spotted by [excavators](<../Technology/Excavator.md>): workers who must spend far more time in the Shifting Lands than any other fae. With one exception, only one excavator will witness an exfae per sighting, usually the excavator keeping watch for changes in [weather](<../Locations/Shifting Lands.md#Weather>) while the rest of the crew works nearby. In all cases, the rest of crew reportedly looks too late, brushes off the claim, or cannot spot what the witness is pointing out.

No witness has claimed seeing an exfae more than once.

## Descriptions
Witnesses of exfae often describe them as "vaguely fae-like" with mutations similar to those seen in metamutagen-poisoned [fae](<./Fae.md>), but to a more extreme sense. Some witnesses describe them more serpentine or even squid-like. They are purportedly sighted alone or in groups of up to three. Witnesses claim that exfae will seem to watch them from a distance, usually before turning around and walking away.

## Individual Cases
A total of 63 exfae sightings have been reported. Below are those with historical significance or notable elements.

*Note: This needs names.*

### Falcon Crew
The earliest case of an exfae occurred during the 49<sup>th</sup> Excavation of the Falcon Crew. Two of the four excavators spotted an exfae simultaneously, though one claims to have spotted a second behind the first. When questioned independently, both fae described the exfae similarly.
> I couldn't make out color or anything, it was dark, and kinda foggy. The silhouette is definitely that of a fae, though. They seemed tall, mostly in the legs, like a maned wolf. \[The exfae was] far, but I could see they were looking right at me. And then they turned, looked at me over their shoulder, and walked away. Almost like they were beckoning me to follow. We were stunned at what we saw. We stayed there after the stranger left. 

This is the only witness account in which two fae saw an exfae during the same mission. 

### Crew #3
Soon after, during the 353<sup>rd</sup> Excavation of Crew #3, excavator ????? claimed witness of an exfae "a great distance away ... with four long legs and four sharp ears, and no \[visible] tail". He reportedly froze in awe for a moment, unsure if what he saw was real. After he called out "Hey!", both to the exfae and the rest of his crew, the exfae seemed to start approaching. Scared, ????? looked away to step closer to his crew, but when he looked back toward the exfae, the exfae was gone.

????? at the time only told his crew that he simply "thought he saw something" and was mistaken, which they accepted without question. Feeling guilt, however, he later confessed to his crew, who, alongside ?????, reported the incident to [Io](<../Locations/Western Citadels/Io.md>).

It is unknown if ????? was familiar with the previous incident involving Falcon Crew. The former incident wasn't publicly known until after the third incident. However, critics of this case suggest that the rumor may have spread among excavators before this incident.

### Agate Crew
The third incident occurred during the 72<sup>nd</sup> excavation of Agate Crew. Similarly to the previous encounters, the witness, ?????, reported seeing a long-legged exfae with multiple ears, though this time, it had a long, felid tail. A second exfae then rose beside the first, as though standing up from behind something.

Both exfae were about 25 meters away, according to the witness. Thinking she was seeing her own crew mates, ????? called out to the exfae, "You're too far!" When the two exfae didn't react, she walked closer, assuming they couldn't hear her. This immediately caused the exfae to turn around and start walking away

A member of ?????'s crew approached her to ask what she was doing. Reportedly, the exfae were still in her sight at this time, though just barely. She turned to her crewmate to reply, but froze upon seeing the rest of her crew still behind her, setting up.

The rest of the crew gave statements; each correlated with ?????'s testimony. ????? has remained very consistent with her story, though she is currently unsure whether what she saw was an exfae or an illusion. She no longer talks to the press about her experience, however, citing exhaustion and annoyance.

After this incident, scientists coined the term "extraluxtian fae" to describe these "strangers". News publications picked up on the shortened form, "exfae", which soon after became the official term.

### Meloncruncher Crew
During the 9<sup>th</sup> Expedition of the Meloncruncher Crew, ????? allegedly saw two exfae while investigating a dig site. This was the first report with a clear visual description of the exfae.

According to ?????, he was behind a small hill when he saw an exfae past another hill in the distance. He claims that it was "kind of like a white [fox](<./Species/Fox.md>)" with long rabbit-like ears and tail. Something bright red was on its side, which he specified "wasn't blood, but something solid".

????? crawled over the first hill to get to the second in hopes of getting a better look. As he did, a sudden momentary fluctuation in the [æther](<./Æther.md>) forced him to take cover. When he looked back, the ground was cracked dry, clearly affected by the fluctuation. Yet, the exfae was still there.

The exfae then noticed ????? and seemed to freeze up. ????? then rushed out into the clearing in an attempt to catch up with the exfae. In response, the exfae darted away at incredible speed. It allegedly moved as though it was leaping, though it did not rise from the ground.

While apart from his crew, ????? sustained cuts on his face and chest, and in his mouth and throat, from the higher exergy. According to his account, he hadn't realized he was getting cut at the time, or that he had wandered too deep into the Shifting Lands, until after the exfae left. He returned to his crew, who, upon seeing his injuries, cut the expedition short.

????? did not tell his crew exactly what happened or report the sighting, mostly because the distance he went from his crew was a violation of safety rules possibly serious enough to cost him his job. The story only surfaced when his wife at the time, ??????, spotted the account in his personal diary and brought it to a newspaper.

Though he does not like talking about his experience, ????? confirmed with the press that the story was true. He attended a couple small interviews before he detached himself from the public, wishing to distant himself from his experience. He soon after retired from excavation and started a small farm in [{{NORTH}}](<../Locations/{{NORTH}}.md>).

The expedition took place in the morning, and the weather was quite foggy.

> It may've been a lot like a slug, a big slug, with many eyestalks, a dozen of them. They'd come up and go back down in a flowing kinda way. I was staring, I was horrified, stunned even! ... After a few \[minutes], but what felt like an hour, it did leave. It sorta lowered all its eyestalk things down at once and I think slithered away. I couldn't tell. I could move again, so I went to my crew and told them everything.

????? claimed to see three exfae atop a slope. According to him, they were not tall but did have four ears, as well as possibly a short, think horn on their foreheads. At his distance, he couldn't make out details or colors, though he believes they had dark pelts.

He initially thought it was another excavation crew and flagged them down. When they didn't respond, he started moving toward them. He quickly stepped back, though, when he started feeling himself warming up and vibrating inside.

According to ?????, the middle exfae then called out to him in an unknown language. He described the voice as "weak, raspy, like a fae who smokes daily". The middle exfae then turned and walked away, followed by the other two.

Though the rest of the crew did not see the exfae, they did reportedly hear the voice. One of the excavators even described it as sounding "southern". However, that excavator and one other would later recant their testimonies and refuse any further communication about the voice.

 ????? initially brought the story directly to the press, though each news agency he contacted refused his story. He then reported it to his citadel, [Ganymede](<../Locations/Western Citadels/Ganymede.md>), though they too disregarded his account. According to his wife, ??????, he became adamant about his experience and "grew mad" over how lightly others were taking it. He often spoke about heading back out into the Shifting Lands with a camera to find the exfae again.

Over a week after the incident, the day before ???????? Crew's next expedition, ?????? awoke to find ????? missing. He left behind a note stating that he was going to the Shifting Lands. Surveillance cameras in the [{{TUNNEL}}](<../Locations/{{TUNNEL}}.md>) confirmed that he entered the Shifting Lands alone very early in the morning, but never returned. Despite several crews' attempts to find him, ????? was never seen again.

## Theories
Multiple theories from witnesses, supporters, critics, and scientists alike attempt to describe the phenomenon behind exfae sightings.

In a survey, 26% of fae believe exfae are real, 45% believe exfae do not exist, and 29% are unsure.

### Hoax
The easiest explanation, and the most favored among critics, is that most (or possibly all) sightings are a hoax. According to this theory, witnesses may want to bring attention to themselves or their crew, or may even want to cover up workplace negligence; witnesses usually report seeing exfae while apart from their group, which is in violation of safety regulations. 

Investigations regarding the latter explanation, however, have not found misconduct to be a factor. Often, the witnesses are tasked to keep an eye on changes in the environment, which may involve them stepping somewhat further from the group, within reason.

### Pareidolia
Many scientists and critics believe that witnesses may be mistaking mundane objects for [bodies](<./Body.md>). Due to the chaotic nature of the Shifting Lands, jagged rocks and unusual pillars of dirt or stone are commonplace. Credible witnesses claim that the exfae is far away or obscured by fog, which adds credence to this. 

The reported movements of exfae may thus be the objects coincidentally falling or crumbling.

### Æthereal Hallucination
Some scientists postulate that an unknown physical phenomenon may be at play. Since a fae's [spark](<./Spark.md>) exists on the [æther](<./Æther.md>), it is of course susceptible to the more extreme fluctuations in the Shifting Lands. The theory is that these fluctuations are capable of impacting the spark in a way to cause hallucinations.

According to modern understandings of the body and spark, however, the body processes the senses, such as vision, entirely on its own regardless of the presence of a spark.

Yet, the spark can *indirectly* affect the body, including its sensory organs, by manipulating [exergy](<./Exergy.md>). It would require very little force for a spark to cause major hallucinations to a body it is [diffused](<./Diffusing.md>) into.

Currently, scientists can only recreate momentary flashes of light or clusters of bright "stars" within a fae's vision, and doing so requires the fae to [sequence](<./Sequencing.md>).

### Traveling Fae
The most accepted theory in favor of the existence of exfae is that they are visitors or travelers from other places in the world.

[Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>) is currently avoiding [New Existence](<../Locations/New Existence.md>) with the natural capacitance of its [Cirrolite Core](<../Locations/Cirrolite Core.md>). Prior to [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>), other similar natural [cirrolite](<../Technology/Cirrolite.md>) structures existed. It is currently unknown whether any of these other locations have survived The Shattering like Luxtia, as communication through the Shifting Lands is currently impossible.

In the case other regions did survive, it may then be possible that fae in those regions may have found a way to traverse the Shifting Lands and are attempting to find other survivors. These exfae may have become mutated as a result of their journey through Shifting Lands, explaining their unusual shapes.

This theory has two major flaws. First, no communication has been established with any other regions. Luxtian [Citadels](<../Locations/Citadel.md>) are currently closer to creating a radio powerful enough to send a message through the Shifting Lands than they are to equipping fae to travel deeper into the Shifting Lands at all. Other regions would presumably be in a similar situation. 

Additionally, in most credible cases, exfae are described as walking away from the witness without attempting contact. This is inherently counterintuitive to the claim that these are travelers searching for other regions.

### Survivors
A similar theory, though less popular, is that exfae are fae who somehow survived The Shattering. The apparent mutations in exfae would therefore be a result of the extreme changes in exergy or even adaptations to [New Existence](<../Locations/New Existence.md>). The latter case could explain why exfae avoid contacting excavators: just as fae may be unable to survive in New Existence, exfae may be unable to survive in the "old existence" within the Cirrolite Core.

The main issue with this theory is that scientists have yet to create, let alone investigate, a scenario in which any fae could survive The Shattering. The extreme changes in exergy alone could scorch or lacerate a fae in an instance. Even if these fae were as close to Luxtia as they've been witnessed, the initial fluctuations would certainly have killed them.

Yet, fae are still susceptible to this deeper in the Shifting Lands, where many exfae have been spotted. This could be in favor of them somehow being resilient toward the effects of extreme exergy.

### Spontaneous Fae
A few fae have speculated that exfae may have simply formed in the Shifting Lands. The more chaotic fluctuations are statistically more likely to create a spark, though a body is less likely to form. Still, enough time has elapsed that  spontaneous body formation is, although unlikely, still possible. These bodies would only need a sufficiently complex brain and enough bone mass, and would need to be resilient against extreme exergy.

This theory is, however, only speculation. Most of the math works out, though how a body could withstand the deeper parts of Shifting Lands is unknown.

### Lost Excavators
This theory revolves around the idea that a crew of excavators, often cited as the "true" Crew #1, ventured too far and were thought to be dead. In an attempt to cover this death up, Io, the citadel in charge of all excavations early on, created a new crew of similar-looking fae to take the old crew's place. Yet, according to this theory, the "true" crew survived and adapted to the Shifting Lands, unable to leave New Existence as a result. 

This theory is rare, appealing mostly to conspiratorially-minded fae. Excavation Crew #1 is still active and denies the story entirely.

## Concerns
Though most fae doubt the existence of exfae, the [citadels](<../Locations/Citadel.md>) still investigate reports as a safety measure. If exfae are real, contacting them would be extremely beneficial. Even if exfae are illusionary, the phenomenon causing the illusions may be of interest. 

However, public perception over exfae has deteriorated to the point that excavators feel less inclined to report unusual sightings, often in fear of ridicule. This extends to far more serious issues: for example, excavators have reportedly hesitated to report signs of changing [weather](<../Locations/Shifting Lands.md#Weather>) in fear of making a false report. Citadels have attempted to quell this fear with informative meetings and anonymous reporting systems.
