The **ætherwolves** are four [fae](<./Fae.md>) with a [wolf](<./Body.md#Wolf>) [bodies](<./Body.md>) and particularly strong specialized [sparks](<./Spark.md>). Each watches over a quarter of [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>), which they claim as their **domain**.

The four ætherwolves are:
- [Avia](<../Characters/Avia.md>) of [{{NORTH}}](<../Locations/{{NORTH}}.md>)
- [Jaki](<../Characters/Jaki.md>) of [Serra](<../Locations/Serra.md>)
- [Myla](<../Characters/Myla.md>) of [{{WEST}}](<../Locations/{{WEST}}.md>)
- [Wulg](<../Characters/Wulg.md>) of [{{EAST}}](<../Locations/{{EAST}}.md>)

## Origins
The four ætherwolves formed before [the Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>).
