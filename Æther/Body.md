The **body** is the physical and instinctual component of a [fae](<./Fae.md>), as opposed to the [spark](<./Spark.md>).

In a Freudian analogy, a fae's body would be their id, their spark would be their super-ego, and the consciousness resulting from the combination of the two would be their ego.

## Species
A body can be of many different species. Listed below are the species that currently may have sparks; in other words, these are the species that can be fae. Their body's disposition mostly describes a sparkless animal's behavior, though it can loosely influence fae, especially those that acquired a spark after birth.

The following fae-compatible species are native to [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>):
- [Bear](<./Species/Bear.md>)
- [Fox](<./Species/Fox.md>)
- [Lynx](<./Species/Lynx.md>)
- [Raven](<./Species/Raven.md>)
- [Wolf](<./Species/Wolf.md>)

The following are native to a region formally located south of Luxtia who may have been living or working in the region prior to [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>):
- [Coyote](<./Species/Coyote.md>)
- [Raccoon](<./Species/Raccoon.md>)

The following are native to a far further and much warmer region:
- [Cheetah](<./Species/Cheetah.md>)
- [Hyena](<./Species/Hyena.md>)
- [Tiger](<./Species/Tiger.md>)

Many more species exist in Luxtia that cannot be found as a fae for whatever reason. This includes fishes, rodents, reptiles, hares, various hooved animals, and more.
