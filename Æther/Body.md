The **body** is the physical and instinctual component of a [fae](<./Fae.md>), as opposed to the [spark](<./Spark.md>).

In a Freudian analogy, a fae's body would be their id, their spark would be their super-ego, and the consciousness resulting from the combination of the two would be their ego.

## Species
A body can be of many different species.

Listed below are species that exist in [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>) and can have sparks; in other words, these are the species that can be fae. Their body's disposition mostly describes a sparkless animal's behavior, though it can influence fae, especially those that acquired a spark after birth.

### Cheetah
A **cheetah** is a large feline animal. It has long legs, a lithe build, a small head, and typically spotted fur. It is incredibly quick, capable of running faster than any other animal.

Cheetah bodies are careful and fairly territorial. Unlike many other predators in Luxtia, cheetahs are more active in the day. They often meow, purr, growl, and chitter. They may be nomadic until they find the ideal place to settle down, and they may settle down on their own or in groups. Like other felines, they hunt by stalking as close as they can before giving chase.

### Enfield
An **enfield** is a small or medium canine animal with avian features. Its front legs resemble those of a bird-of-prey, with talons instead of paws. It may otherwise resemble a [fox](<#Fox>) or [wolf](<#Wolf>), but with feathers, often branching from its front legs like wings. Enfields are very flexible.

Enfield bodies are tenacious, solitary, and territorial. They either hide from others or attack to scare them off. If somebody manages to bond with an enfield, though, then it will stay loyal to them.

### Fox
A **fox** is a small canine animal. It has a narrow and pointed snout, sharp ears, and a considerably bushy tail. Its pelt is often colorful yet may be all black or white. It is more flexible and adaptable than other canines and may even have retractable claws.

Fox bodies tend to be solitary. They are quick and agile enough to throw off anyone trying to follow them. They have complex vocalizations, including howls, whines, barks, screams, and more. They will eat anything they can, though some will prefer specific foods over others. They are known to bury food for later.

## Hyena
A **hyena** is a medium or small animal. It has a very broad snout, a sloped back, and a thick neck. Though it resembles canines and felines, it is neither. It often has a patterned pelt, and it may have longer hairs along its dorsal side. It has an incredibly strong bite, but it lacks flexibility.

Hyena bodies are very opportunistic. They tend to keep alone but may temporarily join groups with others. Some vocalize with whooping howls and with laughing sounds, while others are silent. They prefer meat, which they may hunt for or scavenge.

## Wolf
A **wolf** is a large canine animal. It has a broad snout, round ears, a thick neck, and two layers of fur. It has a strong bite and good endurance.

Wolf bodies are cooperative and social, yet extremely territorial. They prefer to stick to groups (or "packs"), which usually consists of a wolf pair and their children, though younger wolves may leave this group to start their own. They are known for their loud prolonged "howl", which they use to find and bond with wolves in their pack, and to keep other wolves away. They prefer to eat meat, either from hunting or scavenging.
