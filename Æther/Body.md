The **body** is the physical and instinctual component of a [fae](<./Fae.md>), as opposed to the [spark](<./Spark.md>).

In a Freudian analogy, a fae's body would be their id, their spark would be their super-ego, and the consciousness resulting from the combination of the two would be their ego.

## Species
A body can be of many different species. Listed below are the species that currently may have sparks; in other words, these are the species that can be fae. Their body's disposition mostly describes a sparkless animal's behavior, though it can loosely influence fae, especially those that acquired a spark after birth.

### Cheetah
A **cheetah** is a large feline animal. It has long legs, a lithe build, a small head, and typically spotted fur. It is incredibly quick, capable of running faster than any other animal.

Cheetah bodies are careful and fairly territorial. Unlike many other predators in Luxtia, cheetahs are more active in the day. They often meow, purr, growl, and chitter. They may be nomadic until they find the ideal place to settle down, and they may settle down on their own or in groups. Like other felines, they hunt by stalking as close as they can before giving chase.

Cheetahs are native to a former land that was far warmer than [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>). Local cheetahs have adapted to the cold, growing longer pelts.

### Fox
A **fox** (specifically, the red fox) is a small canine animal. It has a narrow and pointed snout, sharp ears, and a considerably bushy tail. Its pelt is often colorful yet may be all black or white. It is more flexible and adaptable than other canines and may even have retractable claws.

Fox bodies tend to be solitary. They are quick and agile enough to throw off anyone trying to follow them. They have complex vocalizations, including howls, whines, barks, screams, and more. They will eat anything they can, though some will prefer specific foods over others. They are known to bury food for later.

### Hyena
A **hyena** is a medium animal. It has a very broad snout, a sloped back, and a thick neck. Though it resembles canines and felines, it is neither. It often has a patterned pelt, and it may have longer hairs along its dorsal side. It has an incredibly strong bite, but it lacks flexibility.

Hyena bodies are very opportunistic. They tend to keep alone but may temporarily join groups with others. Some vocalize with whooping howls and with laughing sounds, while others are silent. They prefer meat, which they may hunt for or scavenge.

Hyenas are not native to Luxtia. Hyena fae were likely visiting Luxtia during [The Shattering](<../Events/The Shattering.md>).

### Lynx
A **lynx** (specifically, the Canadian lynx) is a medium feline animal. It has a short snout, pointy ears with sharp tufts, enormous paws with retractable claws, and a short tail. It is lean with a small head. Its legs are thick, with its hind legs longer than its front legs.

Lynx bodies are solitary and mobile. They can swim, climb, and run well in any kind of environment within Luxtia. They avoid other animals, preferring to stay completely alone. Instead of chasing their prey, lynxes will hide and wait near where their prey tends to travel. They especially love to eat hare; besides some other meats, they will not (and often cannot) eat anything else.

### Raccoon
A **raccoon** is a small musteloid animal. It has a wide face and stout build. It is easy to recognize by its mask-like face markings and ringed tail. Its front paws are incredibly dexterous, allowing it to manipulate tools much better than most other fae. They are also capable of a bipedal stance, at least for a moment.

Raccoon bodies are clever and adaptable. They are not picky about what they eat; they can eat a broad range of food. They are curious and interact mostly with touch; they will touch, scrape, and pick up novel items to investigate them. They communicate with chittering sounds. They are most active at night.

### Raven
A **raven** (specifically, the common raven) is a small avian animal. It is the only non-mammalian animal to be capable of being a fae. It has a plumage of iridescent black feathers and a fairly thick beak.

Raven bodies are adaptable and incredibly intelligent, capable of creating and using tools even without a spark. They are somewhat territorial but may travel in flocks. They can eat insects and small seeds or fruit, but they are more often seen feeding on carrion.

The fact ravens can have sparks is unusual, as all other bodies are mammalian. The close relationship between ravens and wolves, and the species' spectacular intelligence, may have contributed to this.

### Wolf
A **wolf** (specifically, the grey wolf) is a large canine animal. It has a broad snout, round ears, a thick neck, and two layers of fur. It has a strong bite and good endurance.

Wolf bodies are cooperative and social, yet extremely territorial. They prefer to stick to groups (or "packs"), which usually consists of a wolf pair and their children, though younger wolves may leave this group to start their own. They are known for their loud prolonged "howl", which they use to find and bond with wolves in their pack, and to keep other wolves away. They prefer to eat meat, either from hunting or scavenging.

Wolves are believed to have acquired sparks earlier than any other species currently capable of having a spark. All four [ætherwolves](<./Ætherwolf.md>) are wolves, as the name implies.
