**Æthereal wind** is the random noise of lower relative [energy](<./Energy.md>) present in all of the [æther](<./Æther.md>). It influences how energy dissipates (as it will naturally dissipate into regions with the greatest difference in energy) and thus has "direction" in the æther.

Wind can damage [resolved](<./Resolving.md>) [sparks](<./Spark.md>) by shaving off its outer layers, reducing its power.
