**Æthereal wind** is the random low-intensity noise of relative [exergy](<./Exergy.md>) present in all of the [æther](<./Æther.md>). It influences how exergy dissipates (as it will naturally dissipate into regions with the greatest difference in exergy).

Wind can damage [resolved](<./Resolving.md>) [sparks](<./Spark.md>) by shaving off its outer layers, reducing its power.

In the non-force-carrier model of the æther, wind is believed to be the waves that "move" forces in the æther.
