A **fae** is any [body](<./Body.md>) with a [spark](<./Spark.md>). This results in them having consciousness and self-awareness, or "sentience".

## Body
All animals have a body, but only certain species have acquired sparks. A species must have a bone skeleton to be capable of holding a spark. An animal must acquire a spark (which can happen spontaneously, though that is very rare) and be able to reproduce with another biologically compatible fae (with a spark; animals without sparks cannot give birth to fae). Only then can a fae be that species.

Fae can be found in [Luxtia](<../Locations/Luxtia.md>) with the following kinds of bodies:
- [Cheetah](<./Body.md#Cheetah>)
- [Fox](<./Body.md#Fox>)
- [Hyena](<./Body.md#Hyena>)
- [Lynx](<./Body.md#Lynx>)
- [Raccoon](<./Body.md#Raccoon>)
- [Raven](<./Body.md#Raven>)
- [Wolf](<./Body.md#Wolf>)

## Spark
The spark provides the body with [sapience](<../Phenomena/Consciousness.md>) by increasing their brain's function. Fae attribute a lot of personality and emotions to the spark; a fae will often call their personality their "spark". In reality, their personality and emotions come mostly come their brain's enhanced functions. The spark can, however, retain [memories](<../Phenomena/Memory.md>).

A fae acquires their spark through one of three ways:
1. **Birth.** If both parents have a spark, the child will always have a spark.
2. **Uplifting.** Another fae can artificially [resolve](<./Resolving.md>) a spark into a body. Though the technology required to create or isolate a spark is limited and expensive, and though it may be morally dubious, some scientists have nonetheless experimented with this.
3. **Quantum Fluctuations.** A body with a sufficiently complex brain and with enough bone mass can spontaneously acquire a spark through fluctuations in the [æther](<./Æther.md>). This is incredibly rare.
